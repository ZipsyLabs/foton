# React Counter dApp tutorial

This tutorial goes through the process of setting up the application that implements the on-chain counter with increment feature in React.

As a result of this tutorial, we are going to create a dApp that can connect to a TON wallet, deploy counter smart contract, read its state and run the Add or Subtract contract functions. You will get to know TON and specifically Foton development with this hands-on experience.

Make sure you have a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18 or higher installed on your machine.

## Create Vite app

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a modern bundler for single-page web applications. The following command will help you to create a template application that we are going to fill with decentralization later. It will prompt you to select a project name, framework, whether TypeScript is needed or not.

For this tutorial, select React framework (TypeScript + SWC preset). Notice that Foton is not tied to any of the frameworks and can work both in the browser and in the server environment.

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
npm create vite@latest
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
yarn create vite
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
pnpm create vite
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Since the application deals with cryptography, we need to adjust the template by adding Buffer polyfill. Install the Vite plugin for it:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
npm install -D vite-plugin-node-polyfills
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
yarn add -D vite-plugin-node-polyfills
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
pnpm add -D vite-plugin-node-polyfills
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Now, head to the `vite.config.ts` file and update the `plugins` section.

```ts  filename="vite.config.ts" {3,8-10}
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react-swc';
import { nodePolyfills } from 'vite-plugin-node-polyfills';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    nodePolyfills({
      include: ['buffer'],
    }),
  ],
})
```

## Add and compile your first contract

TON blockchain supports three smart contract languages: Fift, FunC, and [Tact](https://tact-lang.org/). This tutorial focuses on the Tact since it is the only high-level language from the list and the easiest of them to get started with.

Let's write the first contract in the `contracts/counter.tact` file:

```tact filename="contracts/counter.tact"
import "@stdlib/deploy";

message Add {
  queryId: Int as uint64;
  amount: Int as uint32;
}

message Subtract {
  queryId: Int as uint64;
  amount: Int as uint32;
}

contract Counter with Deployable {
  counter: Int as uint32;

  init() {
    self.counter = 0;
  }

  receive(msg: Add) {
    self.counter += msg.amount;
  }

  receive(msg: Subtract) {
    self.counter -= msg.amount;
  }

  get fun counter(): Int {
    return self.counter;
  }
}
```

We are not going to cover the language features here, so please refer to the [Tact book](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book) for learning its syntax and semantics.

To put it simply, the Counter contract has only one variable in its state called `counter` with type `uint32`. It also has two methods (receivers) `Add` and `Subtract`, which increase or decrease the `counter` value by the provided amount. Lastly, the `counter` getter returns the value of the `counter` state.

Now, we need to install the Tact compiler to process the smart contract:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
npm install -D @tact-lang/compiler
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
yarn add -D @tact-lang/compiler
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
pnpm add -D @tact-lang/compiler
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Then, let's create a configuration file `tact.config.json` for the Tact compiler that will point to the `.tact` files and define the output folder.

```json filename="tact.config.json"
{
  "$schema": "http://raw.githubusercontent.com/tact-lang/tact/main/grammar/configSchema.json",
  "projects": [
    {
      "name": "counter",
      "path": "./contracts/counter.tact",
      "output": "./contracts/counter"
    }
  ]
}
```

When the configuration is ready, we only need to modify the `scripts` object of the `package.json`:

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "compile": "tact --config ./tact.config.json"
  }
}
```

Compile your first smart contract:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
npm run compile
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
yarn compile
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
pnpm compile
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

If you open the `contracts/counter` directory, you will see many files created by Tact: ABI file, MD file, PKG file, results of compilation to FunC and Fift languages. However, the most important file of all compilation is the `counter_Counter.ts`. Take a moment to look and read the resulting `Counter` class.

Let's export the `Counter` class for the future usage. Create `contracts/index.ts` file:

```ts filename="contracts/index.ts"
export { Counter } from './counter/counter_Counter';
```

## Making a dApp

To create a dApp, let's install the `@zipsylabs/fotonjs-core` library:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
npm install @zipsylabs/fotonjs-core @ton/core
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
yarn add @zipsylabs/fotonjs-core @ton/core
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
pnpm add @zipsylabs/fotonjs-core @ton/core
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

In order to allow the app to be connected to wallets in TON, the app must provide a **manifest**. The manifest is a JSON file with a name, URL and icon of the dApp. In Vite, the best place to put it is `public/tonconnect-manifest.json`:

```json filename="public/tonconnect-manifest.json"
{
  "name": "Counter",
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "icon": "https://example.com/icon.png"
}
```

The manifest must be accessible via its URL. That means that you should deploy the Counter dApp with the manifest file, get the link and use it with Foton. If you are not ready to deploy the app, you can use the Foton's manifest: https://counter.foton.sh/tonconnect-manifest.json.

Foton library lets you create clients – interfaces to interact with the TON blockchain. There are four main clients:
1. `WalletClientUI` – connect to a wallet on TON and send basic transactions with a user interface. To connect, user will choose in a modal window from one of many wallets. Available only in browser environment.
2. `WalletClient` – connect to any wallet on TON without user interface. Available in both server and browser environments.
3. `PublicClient` – read data from the blockchain. Does not require a wallet connection.
4. `ContractClient` – deploy smart contracts to the blockchain, call their methods, and read their states.

For this tutorial, we will need a wallet client with UI, public client, and a contract client. Let's define them in `src/ton-clients.ts`:

```ts filename="src/ton-clients.ts"
import { createWalletClientUI, createPublicClient, createContractClient } from '@zipsylabs/fotonjs-core';

import { Counter } from '../contracts';

export const walletClient = createWalletClientUI({
  // Use TON testnet for development purposes
  chain: 'testnet',
  // Provide a link to the deployed manifest file
  manifestUrl: 'https://counter.foton.sh/tonconnect-manifest.json',
  // If the wallet was already connected, restore the connection immediately
  restoreConnection: true,
});

export const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  api: 'testnet',
  // Provide your API key from Ton Center to increase the rate limits
  // authToken: 'token'
});

export const counterClient = createContractClient({
  // Use compiled Counter contract for the contractClient
  contract: Counter,
  // Provide the public and wallet clients to the contract client,
  // so it can access both the public method and the wallet connection
  publicClient,
  walletClient,
});
```

Having the clients defined, you can easily interact with the blockchain! We can start by connecting to the wallet in `src/use-wallet.tsx`:

```tsx filename="src/use-wallet.tsx"
import { useMemo, useState } from 'react';

import { walletClient } from './ton-clients.ts';

export const useWallet = () => {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const [userAddress, setUserAddress] = useState<string>();

  // Don't show the full address, only the first and last characters. It also saves space
  const shortAddress = useMemo(() => {
    if (!userAddress) return '';
    return userAddress.slice(0, 5) + '...' + (userAddress || '').slice(-4);
  }, [userAddress]);

  // Open wallet connection modal and wait while users connects. Show loading spinner meanwhile.
  const onConnect = async () => {
    setLoading(true);

    const res = await walletClient.connect();
    if (res.error) {
      alert(res.error.message);
    } else {
      setUserAddress(res.data.account.address);
    }

    setLoading(false);
  };

  const onDisconnect = async () => {
    setLoading(true);
    const res = await walletClient.disconnect();
    if (res.data) {
      setUserAddress(undefined);
    }
    setLoading(false);
  };

  const connectButton = (
    <button disabled={loading} onClick={onConnect}>
      {loading ? 'Loading...' : 'Connect'}
    </button>
  );

  const disconnectButton = (
    <button disabled={loading} onClick={onDisconnect}>
      {loading ? 'Loading...' : 'Disconnect'}
    </button>
  );

  return {
    userAddress: shortAddress,
    connectButton,
    disconnectButton,
  };
};
```

In this hook we defined the basic logic for connecting and disconnecting the wallet. The same can be easily done with the Counter contract. Create a new file `src/use-contract.tsx`:

```tsx filename="src/use-contract.tsx"
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { parseTon } from '@zipsylabs/fotonjs-core';

import { counterClient, publicClient } from './ton-clients.ts';

// Define localStorage key for storing the deployed smart contract address without deploying it each time.
const LS_KEY = 'counter-contract-address';

export const useContract = () => {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

  const [contractAddress, setContractAddress] = useState<string | undefined>(localStorage.getItem(LS_KEY) || undefined);
  const [counterAmount, setCounterAmount] = useState<number | undefined>(undefined);

  // When the contract address is set, update the localStorage too
  const setAddress = (address: string) => {
    localStorage.setItem(LS_KEY, address);
    setContractAddress(address);
  };

  // Set contract address for the contractClient on initial render.
  // This way Foton will know to which contract to send the requests.
  useEffect(() => {
    counterClient.setAddress(contractAddress);
  }, []);

  // Subscribe to the counter state with interval
  useEffect(() => {
    getCounterAmount();

    const interval = setInterval(getCounterAmount, 5000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, [contractAddress]);

  // Read the counter state from the contract with the getter 'counter'
  const getCounterAmount = async () => {
    if (!contractAddress) return;

    const res = await counterClient.read({
      getter: 'counter',
      arguments: [],
    });
    if (typeof res.data === 'number') {
      setCounterAmount(res.data);
    }
  };

  // Deploy the contract with 0.05 TON and with random queryId (alternative to `seqno`)
  const onDeploy = async () => {
    const res = await counterClient.deploy({
      value: parseTon('0.05'),
      arguments: [],
      payload: {
        queryId: BigInt(Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000)),
      },
    });

    if (res.data) {
      setAddress(res.data.address);
    } else {
      alert(res.error.message);
    }
  };

  // Increment the counter by amount:1 on-chain with 0.05 TON
  const onIncrement = async () => {
    if (!contractAddress) return;

    setLoading(true);

    const res = await counterClient.write({
      method: 'Add',
      value: parseTon('0.05'),
      payload: {
        queryId: 1n,
        amount: 1n,
      },
    });

    // If the transaction was successful, wait for the transaction receipt with the help of the publicClient
    if (res.data) {
      await publicClient.waitForTransaction({ hash: res.data });
    } else {
      alert(res.error?.message || '');
    }

    setLoading(false);
  };

  const deployButton = (
    <button onClick={onDeploy}>
      Deploy Counter contract
    </button>
  );

  const counterButtons = (
    <>
      <span>Counter: {counterAmount?.toString()}</span>
      <button disabled={loading} onClick={onIncrement}>
        {loading ? 'Loading...' : 'Increment'}
      </button>
    </>
  );

  return {
    contractAddress,
    deployButton,
    counterButtons,
  };
};
```

Here is a breakdown of the Foton features used in the hook:
- `contractClient.setAddress()` – sets the address of a contract for the contract client. Without this address, the `write` and `read` methods will throw an error.
- `contractClient.deploy()` – deploys the contract to the blockchain. It requires the value to be sent with the contract, the arguments for the contract constructor, and the payload with the queryId.

This hook deploys the Counter contract, then queries it each 5 seconds to get the current counter value. It also provides a button to increment the counter by 1. Notice how the `counterClient` and `publicClient` are both used for its purposes.

Finally, let's update the main component `src/App.tsx`:

```tsx filename="src/App.tsx"
import './App.css'
import { useWallet } from './use-wallet.tsx';
import { useContract } from './use-contract.tsx';

function App() {
  const { userAddress, connectButton, disconnectButton } = useWallet();
  const { contractAddress, deployButton, counterButtons} = useContract();

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Counter dApp</h1>

      {!userAddress && (
        <div className="card">
          {connectButton}
        </div>
      )}

      {!!userAddress && (
        <div className="card">
          <span>{userAddress}</span>
          {disconnectButton}
        </div>
      )}

      {!!userAddress && !contractAddress && (
        <div className="card">
          {deployButton}
        </div>
      )}

      {!!userAddress && !!contractAddress && (
        <div className="card">
          {counterButtons}
        </div>
      )}
    </>
  )
}

export default App
```

The App component uses two hooks that we defined before to render the Counter dApp in the simplest way. If the user is not connected to the wallet, the connect button is shown. If the user is connected, the address is displayed along with the disconnect button. If the contract is not deployed, the deploy button is shown. Otherwise, the counter value and the increment button are displayed in the component.

And just one final touch. Let's change the styles in `src/App.css`:

```css filename="src/App.css"
#root {
  max-width: 1280px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 2rem;
  text-align: center;
}

.card {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  gap: 12px;
  padding: 2em;
}
```

The application is ready! We can now run it to check the logic. Start the development server:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
npm run dev
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
yarn dev
```
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
```bash
pnpm dev
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` or another link the Vite will give you. You should be able to connect to the wallet, deploy the Counter contract, and increment the counter value. All of this is on chain!
