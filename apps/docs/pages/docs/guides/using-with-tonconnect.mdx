# Using with TON Connect

[TON Connect](https://github.com/ton-connect) is a JavaScript library for connecting a web application to the TON blockchain. It implements [TEP-115](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0115-ton-connect.md) â€“ a unified connection protocol for TON wallets.

Foton uses TON Connect for wallet connection. Therefore, integrating Foton into a project with existing TON Connect libraries is straightforward. All you need to do is to pass the TON Connect instance to the Foton wallet client:

```ts
import { TonConnect } from '@tonconnect/sdk';
import { createWalletClient } from '@zipsylabs/fotonjs-core';

export const tonConnect = new TonConnect({
  manifestUrl: 'https://example.com/tonconnect-manifest.json',
});

export const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  chain: 'mainnet',
  connection: tonConnect,
});
```

Now you can use all the methods from `walletClient` to connect to a wallet, send transactions and more!
